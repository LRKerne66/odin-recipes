  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    In my youth, I learned how to make hamburgers from a celebrity chef who
    insisted that you needed breadcrumbs, egg and seasonings for a truly great
    burger. And that’s how I made it for years, thinking that was the right way.
    After multiple trips to the States (sorry Australia, but no one does burgers
    like America!), too many burgers, and watching countless cooking shows,
    meeting chefs, caterers and restauranteurs, I’ve been converted to the right
    way.No flavourings other than salt and pepper. Just a nice fatty beef mince
    – even from the supermarket.

    <li>Salt and pepper</li>

  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Separate beef into 4 equal portions. Use hands to lightly form into
      patties the size of your buns (mine are about 10 cm / 4") - don't press
      hard, light fingers = soft juicy patties (see video for how I do this).
    </li>
    <li>
      Season generously with salt and pepper on both sides. Make a dent on one
      side (stop burger from become dome shape and shrinking when cooking).
    </li>
    <li>
      Heat 1 tbsp oil in a heavy based skillet or BBQ over high heat. Add onion
      and cook until wilted and caramelised. Season with salt and pepper, then
      remove.
    </li>
    <li>
      Heat 1 tbsp oil until smoking. Add patties and cook for 2 minutes until
      deep golden with a great crust. Do not press! Flip carefully, cook for 1
      minute then top with cheese (if using). Cover with lid and cook for
      further 1 minute until cheese is melted.
    </li>
    <li>Meanwhile, toast the cut side of the buns lightly</li>
    <li>
      To serve: Spread base of buns with sauce / condiment of choice. Top with
      lettuce then tomato, then hamburger patty. Pile over onions, sliced
      pickles, then more sauce/condiments. Top with lid of bun. Serve
      immediately.
    </li>
  </ol>
